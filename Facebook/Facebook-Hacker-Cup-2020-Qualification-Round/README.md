This is the repository to hold my solutions for Facebook Hacker Cup 2020 Qualification Round, questions can be refered from the link given above, I secured 2664/ 32699 Rank. It was my first faceBook competition and I learned a lot. 

Asymptotic Analysis :

Question 1 : Travel Restriction ->  Time Complexity :  Worst Case : O (n^2)
                                                       Best case : O (n)
                                    Space Complexity : O(n)
                                    
Question 2 : Alchemy            ->  Time Complexity :  Worst Case : O (n)
                                                       Best case : O (n)
                                    Space Complexity : O(1)
                        
Question 3 : Timber             ->  Time Complexity :  Worst Case : O ( 2 ^ n )
                                                       Best case : O ( 2 ^ n )
                                    Space Complexity : O( n )
                        
Question 4 : Running on Fumes   ->  Time Complexity :  Worst Case : O ( n * log(m) )
                                                       Best case : O (1)
                                    Space Complexity : O(n)
 
Correct me if my analysis is wrong, or my code can be improved.
